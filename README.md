# Open-Ori-Vent: Portable Origami-Inspired Ventilators

The COVID-19 pandemic is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths
worldwide and remains a challenge that humanity must still overcome. As
hospitals continue to admit critical patients, they face medical
equipment shortages that may hinder life-saving treatments. We seek to
combat this equipment shortage by presenting a proof-of-concept portable
automated ventilator that is:

-   Low cost

-   Simple, Lightweight, Easy-to fabricate

As an open-source project, we will made public all the CAD files as well
as the software. We hope that you can also make your own ventilator
using these instructions! For the current designs, laser cutters and 3d
printers are necessary, though these parts could be cut/printed
elsewhere and then mailed to you for assemble.
